    "- this is a classic graph path counting problem \n",
    "    - the input is essentially given to you as a adjacency list \n",
    "- the question is bit simpler **if the graph was acyclic** (aka a DAG)\n",
    "    - this is not explicitly stated in the question \n",
    "    - but I wrote a helper method `is_dag` that you can run to check, it so happens that both the example input and real input are DAGs\n",
    "    - so we can just use this fact to our advantage\n",
    "    - I guess that you could also infer that \"Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't flow backwards\" implies a DAG \n",
    "        - but idk seems weak, because this reads like it won't flow directly backwards, but you can still get cycles from other paths\n",
    "- this question lends itself nicely to DFS, you can just do \n",
    "    - `res = sum(dfs(neighbour) for neigbhour in graph[node])`) for every `node`\n",
    "    - can apply caching\n",
    "    - this works nicely because DFS naturally respects the dependency order — you fully explore children before returning to the parent\n",
    "        - i.e. the recursion implicitly gives you reverse topological order\n",
    "- but I wanted to try it out with BFS \n",
    "    - for this, you'd need to perform the DP step in **reverse-chronological order**\n",
    "        - you need to do this so that when you do `dp[neighbour]`, you know that `dp[neighbour]` is already computed \n",
    "    - so you must first run topological sort to get the valid ordering \n",
    "    - counting path \n",
    "        - you start from the back, you mark `dp[dst] = 1`\n",
    "        - for every node (going in reverse chronological order), you do `dp[node] = sum(dp[neighbour] for neighbour in graph[node])`\n",
    "        - edges case: since we already set `dp[dst] = 1`, ignore when `node == dst`\n",
    "        - at the end, return `dp[src]`"
