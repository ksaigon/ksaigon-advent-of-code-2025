    "- we can just solve this using brute force\n",
    "    - we can do brute force because we actually need to find the number itself to add them, not just count \n",
    "    - if you're interested in the optimal counting algorithm -- see day2/sidenote.py\n",
    "- so firstly, do some string parsing, to get the individual lines and `start` and `end` for each line \n",
    "- then, we can loop through every number `num` from `start` to `end` (inclusive)\n",
    "    - converting it to string helps here, so `num_str = str(num)`\n",
    "    - if `len(num_str)` is odd, we don't really care about this particular number, because we can't create invalid ids from it \n",
    "    - if it's even, then we it might be possible to create invalid ids\n",
    "        - let `k = len(num_str) // 2`\n",
    "        - and invalid id will have `num_str[0 to k (non-inclusive)] == num_str[k to end]`\n",
    "        - so we can check for this, then add it to `res` if it is invalid"

    "- same string parsing to get each line \n",

    "    - but this time, it's not just about splitting the `num_str` in half to create invalid ID\n",

    "    - ex. `123123` is an invalid ID, with `123` being the root \n",
    "    - so it's required that `len(num_str) is divisible by `len(root)` and `root * x == num_str` (`x >= 2`) for it to be invalid \n",
    "- so at a particular `num_str`, we can try out all possible roots \n",
    "    - ex. `num_str = \"123456\"`, possible roots are `\"1\", \"12\", \"123\", \"1234\", ...` \n",
    "        - (though we don't have to try past `len(num_str) // 2` because we don't have enough space to duplicate the root i.e. `x < 2`)\n",
    "    - so as soon as we find a root that works, we can add `num` to `res` like before \n",
    "        - IMPORTANT: you need to break right away, a particular number should only be considered invalid once even though it might have multiple roots that work \n",
    "        - ex. `num = 111111`, there are many possible roots here, they can be `1` repeated  6 times, or `11` repeated 3 times, or `111` repeated 3 times, etc "
