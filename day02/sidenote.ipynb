    "## Day 2 Part 1 Sidenote\n",
    "- I was looking really hard to find an optimization for part 1\n",
    "    - I thought there was some digit DP/math that we can do to not have to loop over all the options\n",
    "    - and there is a way an optimized way to **count** how many invalid number there are \n",
    "    - however, the question is asking for the sum of all invalid IDs, meaning you actually need to discover the number and add it to the sum\n",
    "        - so brute force is the right way here \n",
    "- but I spent a lot of time looking into the optimized counting version so I'm gonna put it here anyways\n",
    "- as a start, for these digit DP problem, it's easier to find the number of invalid numbers starting from 0 -> `num`\n",
    "    - so for `count_invalid(start -> end)`, we can instead do `count_invalid(0 -> end) - count_invalid(0 -> start - 1)`\n",
    "    - (draw a number line, it'll make sense)\n",
    "- so for our function `count_invalid(num)`, we're counting the number of invalid number in the range of `0 -> num`\n",
    "- let `n = len(num)` (the number of digits num have)\n",
    "    - and we pick a number `x`, `x` can have `L` digits, where `1 <= L <= n` \n",
    "    - we can consider these L cases \n",
    "- if `L < n` \n",
    "    - the digits we pick are not really bounded by the digits of `num` at all \n",
    "    - for example, if `num = 123456`, and `L = 3` &rightarrow; we can pick `x = 999`\n",
    "        - because `L < n`, meaning our `x` is a whole digit place smaller we are in risk of exceeding the upper bound \n",
    "        - and hence never bounded by the digits of `num`\n",
    "    - if `L` is odd, we can't really even form invalid numbers by definition given\n",
    "        - so the number here is just 0 \n",
    "    - if `L` is even, we can form invalid numbers \n",
    "        - let `k = L // 2` (so half of `L`)\n",
    "        - we can pick these first `k` digits digits freely, and then mirror them \n",
    "        - for example, `num = 123456`, and `L = 4` (so `k = 2`)\n",
    "            - we can pick 2 digits to be `99`, and form `x = 9999`\n",
    "            - this number is invalid \n",
    "        - for the first digit, you can choose from `1 -> 9` (because no leading 0)\n",
    "        - for the remaining `k - 1` digits, you can pick from `0 -> 9`\n",
    "        - the math for that is $9 * 10^{k-1}$\n",
    "        - so this is the number of valid numbers we can form when `L < n` and `L` is even \n",
    "- if `L == n`\n",
    "    - this case is a bit more tricky, but instead of digit DP, we can just do math \n",
    "    - let `h` be the chosen `k` characters (so `len(h) = k`)\n",
    "        - i.e. above, `h = 99`, `x = 9999`\n",
    "    - mathematically speaking, $x = (h * 10^k) + h$\n",
    "    - and since $h \\leq n \\Longrightarrow (h * 10^k) + h \\leq n$ \n",
    "    - after some arithmetic, we get $h \\leq \\lfloor \\dfrac{n}{10^k + 1} \\rfloor$\n",
    "        - let's call this `Hmax`\n",
    "    - so among all `k`-digit `h`, the ones that work are exactly $10^{k-1} \\leq h \\leq min(10^k - 1, Hmax)$\n",
    "    - and the count of that interval is just $\\max(0, \\min(10^k-1, Hmax) - 10^{k-1} + 1)$"
