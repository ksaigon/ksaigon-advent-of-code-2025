### ksaigon Advent of Code 2025

This is my first attempt at AoC. Spurred on by a conversation with my coworkers at lunch before my Christmas vacation. And since I don't really know what do with myself on PTO - I thought I'd give it a try. 

Some thoughts:
- I think this year had some quite challenging problems. The problems could definitely be a bit more straightforward in terms of wording though. 
- Some questions are way too hard for "novice programmers" - concepts like DP, topological sort, DFS/BFS definitely require a CS background, or at least familiarty with the DSA.
- Some questions was purposefully misleading, leaving out key details like "input is a DAG", and of course day 12 (see my thoughts). 
- However, I think it's a really interesting way to get familiar with DSA and stretch your DSA muscles. I think it's a bit more engaging then LC. I also like that you can technically brute force everything - only the answer matters, not runtime (actually reflects the Stripe interviewing process a bit).
  - Or, if you're a human calculator, you could probably (after a long time), compute the answer for all the inputs by hand. This should give you a great appreciation of the human mind in the age of LLMs.
- Overall, I really enjoyed working on these problems, though I think you should probably spend your holidays with your family and doing something a bit more productive. 

Viewing the solutions:
- Each folder has a `.py` and `.ipynb` file. 
- The Python file was the raw source code I used to solve the problems, to run, do
    ```shell
    python3 dayX/dayX.py
    ```
  - These are written in percent format to allow easy conversion to Python notebooks (see below), so you can ignore the comments
- The Python notebooks are the better rendered version of the source code. It has documentation of thought process and walkthrough of the solution. If you're looking to understand the code, I'd suggest checking that part out.
