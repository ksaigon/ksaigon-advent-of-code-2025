    "### Part 2\n",
    "- there's a brute force solution that you can take a look at in part2_brute_force.py\n",
    "    - for the brute force, we essentially create the bounded space of red and green \n",
    "    - and from there, we check every pair, make sure that they're bounded within our boundary, and then take their area if so\n",
    "    - this works, just a little slow because you are operating in real unit space, which can be large based on the input \n",
    "    - (i.e. coordinates can be huge (billions), so you cannot build the full grid)\n",
    "- the first optimization we can make is to compress the space \n",
    "    - coordinate compression replaces a huge coordinate space with a small grid **that preserves gemetric relationships that matter**\n",
    "    - the key insight: nothing interesting happens in the vast empty stretches between polygon edges\n",
    "    - so we only keep rows and columns where \n",
    "        - the polygon edges exist\n",
    "        - the “inside vs outside” classification can change\n",
    "    - so we turn `(r, c)` to `(r_id, c_id)` which are bounded by **the number of unique rows and columns** there are \n",
    "    - key trick: add +- 1 neighbours \n",
    "        - this helps the compressed grid not collapse on itself \n",
    "    - now the compressed grid has:\n",
    "        - boundary rows\n",
    "        - interior rows\n",
    "        - exterior rows\n",
    "    - this preserves:\n",
    "        - polygon walls\n",
    "        - interior space\n",
    "        - exterior space\n",
    "- we'll write a helper that converts from `coordinate_space -> collapsed_space`, and we can operate in the collapsed space to keep it simple\n",
    "- afterwards, we want to fill the interior like the question did but for the compressed space \n",
    "    - we can do this using classic BFS `flood_fill` on the compressed grid \n",
    "    - say that `flood_fill` returns a grid `forbidden_cells[r][c] = 1 if (r, c) is NOT in our bounded space`\n",
    "        - this is a little backwards but it works for our purposes\n",
    "        - (trick: start the flood fill from the edges)\n",
    "- now, let's look at every pair of coordinates\n",
    "    - again, we should convert them to the compressed version \n",
    "    - from these, we can make a `row_start, row_end` and `col_start, col_end`\n",
    "    - we just need to traverse the area/cells `(r, c)` covered by these points and make sure `forbidden_cell[r][c] == 0` for all of them \n",
    "    - this could take a while, so we can use DP/prefix sum/precomputation to help us \n",
    "    - the check above is essentially asking, is the rectangle sum of the `forbidden_cell` bounded by `row_start, row_end` and `col_start, col_end` equal to 0?\n",
    "        - DP can help us get the rectangle sum quite quickly \n",
    "        - do the classic DP rectangle sum algorithm on `forbidden_cell`\n",
    "        - now for every pair of points, we have a $O(1)$ way to check if it's bounded correctly or not \n",
    "- with these optimization, we can once again traverse through all the points and consider their area if they're valid"
