    "- from the look of the question, we can guess that it's an interval question \n",

    "- so first, we should create these intervals \n",
    "    - since the question mentioned that the intervals can overlap, that's not really good for us (hard to reason about) &rightarrow; we should merge them\n",
    "    - merging intervals require sorting them first, so sort by start time, and then merge \n",
    "    - idea of merging interval: process interval in order by start time, if start <= last_seen_end, we need to merge these 2 intervals\n",
    "- once you've merged the interval, just need to handle the look up portion for each ID\n",
    "    - we can do a traversal through the intervals to check\n",
    "    - but since the intervals are sorted from our last step &rightarrow; we can instead do **binary search**\n",
    "- binary search \n",
    "    - we should search for **the largest start time that's smaller than target ID**\n",
    "    - `bisect_left(arr, x)`` -> index of the first element ``>= x`, so largest number `< x` is `bisect_left(arr, x) - 1`\n",
    "    - let `insertion_index` be the result of the binary search \n",
    "    - if `insertion_index == 0`, this means that every start time is greater than the target ID, the fruit is for sure spoiled\n",
    "    - if not the index we care about is at `insertion_index - 1`\n",
    "        - we just have to check here that the ID falls between the range at `insertion_index - 1`\n",
